# Estimation of the Age of a Stellar Association  

This project involves analyzing and processing astrophysical data to estimate the age of a stellar association. The methodology includes:  

1. **Data Cleaning**: Initial cleaning was performed using a crossmatch of two astronomical catalogs to ensure data accuracy and consistency.  
2. **Kinematic Property Assignment**: Astrophysical calculations were applied to assign kinematic properties to the stars within the association.  
3. **Outlier Removal**: Identified and removed outliers to improve data reliability.  
4. **Age Estimation**: Calculated the age of the stellar association based on the processed data.  

This project demonstrates expertise in data cleaning, astrophysical modeling, and statistical analysis applied to astronomical datasets.
